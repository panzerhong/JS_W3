<p>After a function has been stored in a variable,
the variable can be used as a function:</p>

<p id="demo"></p>

<script>
var x = function (a, b) {return a * b};
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x(4, 3);
</script>

</body>
</html>


The function above is actually an anonymous function (a function without a name).

Functions stored in variables do not need function names. They are always invoked (called) using the variable name.

The function above ends with a semicolon because it is a part of an executable statement.
