Accessing Object Methods
You access an object method with the following syntax:

objectName.methodName()
You will typically describe fullName() as a method of the person object, and fullName as a property.

The fullName property will execute (as a function) when it is invoked with ().

This example accesses the fullName() method of a person object:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Title</title>
</head>
<body>
<p id="demo"></p>
<script>

    var person = {
        fn : "yin",
        ln : "mazatin",
        age : "90",
        full : function(){
            return this.fn + " " + this.ln;}
    }

    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = person.full();
</script>
</body>
</html>

<!--The this Keyword-->
<!--In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.-->

<!--In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.-->

<!--In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.-->

Methods are functions stored as object properties.

JavaScript Methods
JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects.

A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.

Property	Value
firstName	John
lastName	Doe
age	50
eyeColor	blue
fullName	function() {return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;}
