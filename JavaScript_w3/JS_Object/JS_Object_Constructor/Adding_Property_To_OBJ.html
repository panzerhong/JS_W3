<!--The this Keyword-->
<!--In JavaScript, the thing called this is the object that "owns" the code.-->

<!--The value of this, when used in an object, is the object itself.-->

<!--In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object. The value of this will become the new object when a new object is created.-->

<!--Note that this is not a variable. It is a keyword. You cannot change the value of this.-->

<script>

// Constructor function for Person objects
function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
    this.firstName = first;
    this.lastName = last;
    this.age = age;
    this.eyeColor = eye;
}

// Create 2 Person objects
var myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
var myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");

// Add nationality to first object
myFather.nationality = "English";

// Diplay nationality
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
"My father is " + myFather.nationality+" My mother is "+ myMother.nationality;

</script>

</body>

The property will be added to myFather. Not to myMother. (Not to any other person objects).
