<!--JavaScript Debuggers-->
<!--Debugging is not easy. But fortunately, all modern browsers have a built-in JavaScript debugger.-->

<!--Built-in debuggers can be turned on and off, forcing errors to be reported to the user.-->

<!--With a debugger, you can also set breakpoints (places where code execution can be stopped), and examine variables while the code is executing.-->

<!--Normally, otherwise follow the steps at the bottom of this page, you activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.-->
<!--Debugging is the process of testing, finding, and reducing bugs (errors) in computer programs.-->
<!--The first known computer bug was a real bug (an insect) stuck in the electronics.-->
