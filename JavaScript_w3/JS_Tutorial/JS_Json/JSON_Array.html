<!--JSON is a format for storing and transporting data.-->

<!--JSON is often used when data is sent from a server to a web page.-->
<!--What is JSON?-->
<!--JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation-->
<!--JSON is lightweight data interchange format-->
<!--JSON is language independent *-->
<!--JSON is "self-describing" and easy to understand-->
<!--* The JSON syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but the JSON format is text only. Code for reading and generating JSON data can be written in any programming language.-->

JSON Example
This JSON syntax defines an employees object: an array of 3 employee records (objects):

JSON Example
{
"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
}

JSON Syntax Rules
Data is in name/value pairs
Data is separated by commas
Curly braces hold objects
Square brackets hold arrays

JSON Objects
JSON objects are written inside curly braces.

Just like in JavaScript, objects can contain multiple name/value pairs:

{"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"}


JSON Arrays
JSON arrays are written inside square brackets.

Just like in JavaScript, an array can contain objects:

"employees":[
    {"firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe"},
    {"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith"},
    {"firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones"}
]
