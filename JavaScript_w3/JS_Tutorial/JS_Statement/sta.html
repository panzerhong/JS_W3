JavaScript Code Blocks
JavaScript statements can be grouped together in code blocks, inside curly brackets {...}.

The purpose of code blocks is to define statements to be executed together.

One place you will find statements grouped together in blocks, is in JavaScript functions:

Example
function myFunction() {
    document.getElementById("demo1").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly!";
    document.getElementById("demo2").innerHTML = "How are you?";
}

debugger	Stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function
function	Declares a function
var	Declares a variable
