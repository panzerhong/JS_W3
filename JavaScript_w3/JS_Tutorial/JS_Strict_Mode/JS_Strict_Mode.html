<!--"use strict"; Defines that JavaScript code should be executed in "strict mode".-->

<!--You can use strict mode in all your programs. It helps you to write cleaner code, like preventing you from using undeclared variables.-->

<!--"use strict" is just a string, so IE 9 will not throw an error even if it does not understand it.-->

<h2>With "use strict":</h2>
<h3>Using a variable without declaring it, is not allowed.</h3>

<p>Activate debugging in your browser (F12) to see the error report.</p>
<p id = "demo"></p>

<script>
"use strict";
x = 3.14;    // This will cause an error (x is not defined).
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
</script>

<!--The syntax, for declaring strict mode, was designed to be compatible with older versions of JavaScript.-->

<!--Compiling a numeric literal (4 + 5;) or a string literal ("John Doe";) in a JavaScript program has no side effects. It simply compiles to a non existing variable and dies.-->

<!--So "use strict"; only matters to new compilers that "understand" the meaning of it.-->
